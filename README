# twilio2factor

twilio2factor is a small and simple project used as an initial proof of concept to utilize the great Twilio API combined with node.js and a mongoDB backend to perform simple two factor authentication using voice and SMS. This is a very simple setup and is not recommended for deployment as a production two factor authentication system but it is good enough to give a general idea of how this could be done.

## Features

* Registration of a user and their phone number
* Two factor login using a short lived key that is sent via SMS Text to the user and which expires 2 minutes after it is issued
* Two factor login using a short lived key that is provided to the user via a voice call and which expires 2 minutes after it is issued

## Things to do

* Utilize device/client finger printing to identify a device and match with a user in order to allow for two factor auth only when coming from a new device
* More testing of various attack vectors that could allow the system to be compromised
* Review brute force success failure variation as the key size (number of characters) and complexity varies along with the key life duration
